Certain challenges that the developer had experienced while developing this game and what solutions they provide are also presented to broaden the scope of explanation that this documentation is trying to assert.

### Story

In a seemingly peaceful day, one guy who calls himself a "daredevil" goes on a quest of beating his previous records by improving his survival rate on different highways. In the same day, the daredevil encountered problems on his quest. He realized that he is in fact running on a one way lane, and his only chance of survival is to avoid the cars that are moving towards him.

### Theme

It is depicting an intense survival, car chase vibe. The use of color in this game is intensified and is approriately used in accordance to what setting the character is in. Every element of this game harmonizes in creating an atmosphere that is intense and appropriate for survival games. It has also replicated the nuances of real highway events and car properties. This game should not show gory designs but instead designs that are somewhat similar to reality but have game-like experience.

### Setting

This game is set on three (3) different highways which have different color theme.

**The beach** - which depicts a sunday morning setting of a highway that has houses on the left corner and a beach on the right.
